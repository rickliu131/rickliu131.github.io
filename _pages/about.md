Hi there! I am a senior undergrad at the [University of Michigan](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/) studying Computer Science. I'm fortunate to work at the Human-AI Lab under the supervision of Prof. [Anhong Guo](https://guoanhong.com).
My research interests lie in developing interactive Human-AI systems that enhance accessibility.
